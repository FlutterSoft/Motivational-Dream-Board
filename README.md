# Club Members
A fullstack project utilizing Express, Node.js, Mongoose/MongoDB, Passport.
It allows users to create accounts (and must be logged in to view their members). Each user has their own members database. Sessions are stored allowing users to stay logged in for a period of time when closing tabs. 
Users can add details of club members including name, number, membership level and displays when they joined.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Node.js, Express, Passport, MongoDB, Mongoose, EJS, Javascript, HTML, CSS 

## Optimizations

A way to edit a member instead of having to delete and re add them. 

## Lessons Learned:

A lot about building with MVC in mind as well as fullstack development in general. I have gained a much deeper understanding of MVC architecture, creating user logins with Passport, using Mongoose with MongoDB.
